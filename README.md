## General information

An application that mimics the rules of the Blank Slate card game (i.e. players attempting to unknowingly match words that complete a phrase with another person) with four forward and rear facing navigable cards. The unique twist is flipping the final card reveals a "Will you be my Valentine?" message fashioned with flowing flower petals and [_"My Love Mine All Mine" by Mitski_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwGbMYLjIpQ) playing in the background! 

The reason why I built this was for two simple reasons:
* It's a game my girlfriend and I love to play together.
* To impress my girlfriend on Valentine's Day...it worked! :two_hearts:
